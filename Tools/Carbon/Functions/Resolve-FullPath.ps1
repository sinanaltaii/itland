function Resolve-CFullPath
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Converts a relative path to an absolute path.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    Unlike `Resolve-Path`, this function does not check whether the path exists.  It just converts relative paths to absolute paths.
    
    Unrooted paths (e.g. `..\..\See\I\Do\Not\Have\A\Root`) are first joined with the current directory (as returned by `Get-Location`).
    
    .EXAMPLE
    Resolve-CFullPath -Path 'C:\Projects\Carbon\Test\..\Carbon\FileSystem.ps1'
    
    Returns `C:\Projects\Carbon\Carbon\FileSystem.ps1`.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    Resolve-CFullPath -Path 'C:\Projects\Carbon\..\I\Do\Not\Exist'
    
    Returns `C:\Projects\I\Do\Not\Exist`.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    Resolve-CFullPath -Path ..\..\Foo\..\Bar
    
    Because the `Path` isn't rooted, joins `Path` with the current directory (as returned by `Get-Location`), and returns the full path.  If the current directory is `C:\Projects\Carbon`, returns `C:\Bar`.
